<h3> Arrow 1: Mercy</h3>
<article>
  <p>
    Mercy is not for the weak only, but it is just applicable for the strong.
    Mercy implies I don't have it altogether, I can't do it all myself, I need help.
    Mercy implies I'm not pushing it through using my will, power, or strength.

   My mom fell down the stairs backward recently, my sister called 911.  The paramedics came and transported her on an ambulance
   to the local hospital.  She stayed at the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for ten days.  The doctor in ICU said my mom will stay in
   hospital for some time until she is able to get up herself.  He said she will need some physical therapy.  Yet, a mere week later,
  a hospital worker came in saying my mom will be discharged from the hospital though my mom is still lying on bed in ICU and relying on
    care from attending nurses and physicians.  He's throwing my mom out of the hospital.  This was a shocking news to my mom and my family.
    Isn't it ironic that the hospital's name is Mercy, yet this worker is showing no mercy to us at all ???

   In the Bible, James 2:13 says "Judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.  Mercy triumphs over judgment."
   Yes, indeed, it is easier to judge someone than to be merciful.
   To show mercy to someone means to let go of your judgment, let go of your rightful demand (which can be compensation) over them.
   Simply put, it is to forgo the debt they owe you.

 <p>
   In the Bible there is a parable of two people both owed money (see Luke 7:41-43)
   <pre>
   41 “Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii,[c] and the other fifty.
   42 Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”
   43 Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.”
   “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.
