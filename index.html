<h3> Arrow 1: Mercy</h3>
<article>
  <p>
    The word mercy never appealed to me until recently.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to Merriam Webster dictionary:
    <br />
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <strong><i>mercy </i> </strong>is defined as
       compassion or forbearance shown especially to an offender or to one subject to one's power
      <br /> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp It also means lenient or compassionate treatment as in <i>begging for mercy</i>
  </p>

   My mom fell down the stairs backward recently, my sister called 911.  The paramedics came and transported her on an ambulance
   to the local hospital.  My mom had fractures in her neck, spine, rib and in both wrists.  Even with the slightest movement, she felt immense pain.
   Thankfully her head only suffered bleeding.  One of the nurses said to me that it is a good thing my mom's head is alright because everything else is fixable.
   My mom stayed at the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for ten days.
   The doctor who saw my mom say she will stay in hospital for some time until she is able to get out of bed on her own.  He said she will get some physical therapy at the hospital.
   Yet, eight days later, a hospital worker came and said my mom will be discharged from the hospital the next day though my mom is still lying in bed in ICU and needs assistance on
   almost everything.  He's basically throwing my mom out of the hospital.  This was a shocking news to my mom and my family.
    It's ironic that the hospital's name is Mercy, yet this worker is showing no mercy to my mom or us at all ???
    My mom was allowed to stay one more day in ICU.  Then my mom was discharged, and she went to a rehab facility.

   I thought mercy is only for the weak, for a person who is in distress.
   <br /><strong>BUT, I am wrong.</strong>
   <br />
     Mercy is not just for the weak only, it is for those who are strong enough to admit
     that I do not have it altogether.
     <br />I can't do it all myself; I need help.
   <br />A person shows a strength of character when they are able to face their strengths and weaknesses.
   Only a strong person can truly be honest about their limitations.
 </p>


  <div class="verse">
    "Judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.  Mercy triumphs over judgment." James 2:13 </div>
    <p> Indeed, it is easier to judge someone than to be merciful.
   To show mercy to someone means to let go of your judgment, let go of your rightful demand over them.
   Simply put, it is to forgo the debt they owe you.
 </p>

 <p>
   There is a parable about two people who owed money in the Bible (see Luke 7:41-43)
   <div class="verse">
   41 “Two people owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five hundred denarii and the other fifty. <br />
   42 Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he forgave the debts of both.
   Now which of them will love him more?” <br />
   43 Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt forgiven.”
   “You have judged correctly,” Jesus said.
 </div>
 </p>

<p>
  God show us mercy by giving us His Beloved Son.
  <br /> If you don't think you need God's mercy, just take a deep breath.
   If God didn't create air, you can't even live.
 </p>


  <div class="verse">"Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy." Matthew 5:7</div>
  <div class="ending">
    Those who are shown mercy will show mercy to others.
  </div>
<br />

<div class="verse">
    Let us then approach God's throne of grace with confidence,
    so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.  Hebrews 4:16
  </div>
  <div class="ending">
Mercy is the ability to admit to myself and even to others including God that I am not enough. <br />
I need you God.</div>
